The staff are here to help and want to train us not only to succeed in the main course but also in future professional settings.

Communicating with my classmates will be a useful tool for me in the coming days as I begin to learn things that I may have a harder time grasping.

I worked with a friend and built something simple in ruby last friday, I think it's the perfect start to what I want to try for my project.

The program so far is great and I feel like the help I may need in the future is available to me.
